# python_advertisement_sales

## Objective
Data Prediction using python with libraries (Pandas; Matplotlib; Statsmodels).

Simple linear regression model
>> $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$

* $$y$$ is the predicted numerical value (response) -> *sales*
* x is the feature
* $$\beta_0$$ is called the *intercept*, which is the value of $$y$$ when $$x = 0$$
* $$\beta_1$$ is the coefficient of the feature $$x$$ also called the *slope*, which represent the change in $$y$$ divided by the change in $$x$$
  >> $$\beta_1 = \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$$


## Prerequisites
Download following libraries to your environment:

* Download "statsmodels", "pandas" and "matplotlib" in terminal
```
$ conda install statsmodels
$ conda install matplotlib
$ conda install pandas
```

## How to run the script
Use the following command to execute the script under the src folder:
```
$ python advertisementSales.py
```

## Result
The result will be generated and display on Matplotlib popup after the script has been executed.
Or referring **test/** folder for the result screens.

## Setting Configuration
Please make adjustment in config.json file within the **root/** directory.
